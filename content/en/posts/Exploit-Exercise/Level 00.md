Depress and isolating from other human person create a huge amount of free time for me to pursue further my passion in Cybersecurity. This time, i alocate some of it to write about my Exploit-Exercise whih you can found [here](https://exploit-exercises.lains.space/)

Basically, exploit exercise have 3 main exercise which are Nebula, Protostar and Fusion. Nebula is focusing more on Privilege Escalation in Linux.

## Level 00

## Questions
`Alternatively, look at the find man page. To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.`

## Lab setup
First, lets login to the machine. Since i setup the lab on VMWare Workstation, i just put the machine behind NAT connection and scan the network using `netdiscover`. 

## Connect via ssh

Login using `level00:level00` on ssh and we are in into the machine now.

## Lets get started

The first level on Nebula would be very basic Linux Privilege Escalation technique. Lets try to use `find / -user flag00 -perm -4000`

Quick rundown on the command, `find` is the tools you can found on linux, just like `locate` and `ls`. Then, `/` is on the next queue which indicate that find will crawl over the root `/` of the filesystem. 

Since the instruction needed us to execute this on behalf of `flag00`, here we just indicate `-user flag00` and its following permission `-perm` plus the value of setuid and octal of `-4000`.


Now, this will create a pile of hateful output, we can filter this using `-print 2> /dev/null`. `/dev/null` is kinda black hole in Linux and redirect anything to it can create nice and neat filter.

Ok, we have found the binary, lets run it and get our flag shall we.

We are already become user flag00 and lets just execute `getflag` to get the flag and move to next level. 


## Exploited

we managed to exploit this and reach our target

## Conclusion
- SUID is awesome
